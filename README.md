# Map Edit Tools
Formerly Roof Dev Tool

Adds new tools that make editing the map easier.
To use, just open Architect -> MapTools  
Tools:  
Add/remove any roof type  
Change terrain to any type  
Instantly smooth floor/walls

Feel free to suggest new tools if there is something you want to be able to do (or something you want to be easier to do)
